# BDC 2023 - Water Potability Analysis üö∞

## üèÜ Competition Overview

**BDC 2023 (Big Data Challenge)** was a prestigious competition focused on leveraging data science techniques to solve real-world problems. In this competition, I worked on a project aimed at analyzing the **feasibility of drinking water** by utilizing tabular data. The challenge was to develop models that could accurately classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on various physical and chemical properties.
